"""Pure calendar logic: turn fetched systemd data into CalendarEvents.

No Qt widgets, no subprocess here — this module is the headless, testable core
(it takes already-fetched text/records and returns events), mirroring how
systemd_client's parsers are pure. The Phase-2 plasmoid reuses this module, so
ALL thresholds and time math live here, never in calendar_view.
